\subsection{Demo test 1}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item We have a classical linear model 
\[
    Y_i = \beta_1 + \beta_2 X_i + u_i,
\]
where $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ are fixed parameters, $u_i$ is a disturbance term that is independently and identically distributed with expected value 0 and population variance $\sigma_u^2$ and $i \in \{1, \ldots, n\}$ is the observation index. 
The OLS estimation helps us to obtain the following coefficient $\beta_2$ estimator: 
\[
    \hat\beta_2 = \frac{\sum {X_iY_i}/n - \bar X \bar Y}
    {\sum {X_i^2}/n - (\bar X)^2} = 
    \frac{n \sum_{i=1}^n X_i Y_i - \sum_{i=1}^n X_i \sum_{i=1}^n Y_i}
    {n \sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2 - (\sum_{i=1}^n X_i)^2}.
\]

However, some algebraic transformations allow to show that 
\[
    \hat\beta_2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \bar X)(Y_i - \bar Y)}
    {\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \bar X)^2}.
\]

Prove this is true. 

{\itshape Hint: you can try to solve backwards (going from what you are given to prove to the OLS estimator)}


\item 
A variable $Y_i$ is generated as: 
\[
    Y_i = \beta_1 + u_i,
\]
where $\beta_1$ is a fixed parameter, $u_i$ is a disturbance term that is independently and identically distributed with expected value 0 and population variance $\sigma_u^2$ and $i \in \{1, \ldots, n\}$ is the observation index. 
The least squares estimator of $\beta_1$ is $\bar Y$, the sample mean of $Y$. 
However, a researcher believes that $Y$ is a linear function of another variable $X$ and uses ordinary least squares to fit the relationship:
\[
    \hat Y_i = \hat \beta_1 + \hat \beta_2 X_i,
\]
calculating $\hat \beta_1$ as $\hat Y - \hat \beta_2 \bar X$, where $\bar X$ is the sample mean of $X$. 
Regressor $X$ may be assumed to be a nonstochastic variable. 
Determine whether the researcherâ€™s estimator $\hat \beta_1$ is biased or unbiased, and if biased, determine the direction of the bias.

Unfortunately, some things are missing. Looking at this output, do the following tasks:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item

\subsection{Test 1}

You have 40 minutes to complete the test. Please explain each step of your derivations and state all the assumptions employed. 
Note that different problems can give you different points. Maximum for the test is 10 points.  

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Some practitioners of econometrics consider regressions with transformed variables. 
    For example, if the original model specification is
\[
    Y_i = \beta_1 + \beta_2 X_i + u_i,
\]
the revised specification is
\[
    Y_i^* = \beta_1^* + \beta_2^* X_i^* + v_i,
\]
where
\[
    Y_i^* = \frac{Y_i - a}{c} \text{ and } X_i^* = \frac{X_i - b}{d}.
\]

Knowing that $a, b, c, d$ are some constants and $ c \ne 0, d \ne 0$, express the OLS estimators $\hat\beta_1^*$, $\hat\beta_2^*$ 
in terms of the OLS estimators $\hat\beta_1$, $\hat\beta_2$ [2 points].


\item A novice econometrician estimated a classical linear model 
\[
     Y_i = \beta_1 + \beta_2 X_i + u_i
\]
using 4 observations and obtained the following results:

\begin{tabular}{@{}ccccc@{}}
\toprule
 $Y_i$ & 3 & 7 & 9 & 10\\ 
 $X_i$ & 3 & XXX & XXX & 1\\ 
 $\hat Y_i$ & 4 & 8 & 7 & 11\\ 
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

Help this econometrician find the estimates of the regression coefficients $\hat \beta_1$ and $\hat \beta_2$ [1 point] and restore the missing values in table [1 point]. 
Can you confirm that these estimations were made using the OLS method? [1 point]

Unfortunately, some things are missing. Looking at this output, do the following tasks:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item 
    Give an interpretation of the coefficients estimations [1 point].

    \item
    Find the $R^2$ value [0.5 points].

and $i \in \{1, \ldots, n\}$ is the observation index.


Derive the OLS  $\hat \beta$ estimator.
